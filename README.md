# Resizable-Array
Resizable array is a random access, variable-size list data structure that allows elements to be added or removed. Resizable arrays overcome a limit of static arrays, which have a fixed capacity that needs to be specified at allocation. A resizable array is similar to an array, but with the difference that its size can be dynamically modified at runtime.
